# NLP text analyses
Various Jupyter notebooks on different NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, etc. using deep learning (RNN, LSTM and their derivatives) or machine learning (LDA, NMF, SVD). Currently, the list includes the following notebooks:

1. Covid19 tweet analysis: RNN, LSTM and others

2. Covid19 tweet analysis: CNN networks
    - https://www.kaggle.com/code/lorresprz/covid19-tweet-analysis-cnn-networks

3. Recommender system for movies: TF-IDF
   -  https://www.kaggle.com/code/lorresprz/recommender-system-for-movies-tf-idf

4. Topic Modelling: 2 different unsupervised techniques (LDA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization were used on the BBC article dataset)
   - Topic_Modelling_with_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_(LDA).ipynb
   - Topic_Modelling_with_Non_negative_Matrix_Factorization_(NMF).ipynb
  
5. Spam detection with custom networks (in each of the notebook below, a custom CNN and a custom LSTM was used on the same dataset)
   - Text_Classification_with_Custom_CNNs_[PyTorch].ipynb
   - Spam_detection_with_custom_LSTM.ipynb
  
6. Latent Semantic Analysis with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
   - Latent_Semantic_Analysis_CountVectorizer_SVD.ipynb
